I followed the directions that Shopify provides (https://help.shopify.com/manual/domains/connecting-existing-domains/setting-up-your-domain#add-an-existing-domain-to-your-shopify-store) and changed the DNS settings of my domain. For some reason, it is still not showing my domain as connected to Shopify.
