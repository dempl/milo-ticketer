I can hardly imagine us knowing that you needed the &quot;swapped&quot; version, it&#039;s like you want to buy  Samsung Galaxy S3  from Amazon, and that you require that it says Galaxy S3  [ Not an iPhone ] in the brackets :-)  .  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m really sorry that you feel tricked, it really wasn&#039;t our intention, I and everyone else in this company wants happy customers, because if nothing else, happy customers in time become loyal customers, and they then recommend us to their friends :-)  , but really we cannot issue a refund for the domains, because we also pay the fees to ICANN and VeriSign for the domains. If it were hosting, I would have issued you a refund straight away, no questions asked, but for the domains, I&#039;m afraid I really cannot do much.\r\n\r\nAbout your second remark that we charge a lot for the domain registrations, yes we do,  we indeed charge more for the domains than other companies, but that&#039;s why all our customers get cheapest hosting for 2$/month , and the domain renewal is standard 14.97$ per year. Most of the companies do other way around, i.e. they charge very small amounts for registrations, but then they either charge very high amounts for domain renewals (e.g. 30$/yr  at eNom ) or try to sell you things we give out for free, like WHOIS privacy, DNS editor, &quot;professional&quot; account etc.  (e.g. GoDaddy) .  I&#039;m not saying their business model is bad, but that this is simply the business model we chose, and our customers like it our model general :-)   .   We actually make our living from hosting not from domains, because many of our customers simply like the simple interface for managing their websites and our tech support which doesn&#039;t switch you between 100 departments before you reach the wanted agent.  Our company has 20 employees only and that&#039;s why I like everyone else, can generally help you with any questions you might have, from billing/accounting to domains and hosting, i.e. I won&#039;t gonna have to ask people from 5 departments to simply increase/decrease your disk quota ;-)  .\r\n\r\nNow, your 3rd questions is regarding your domain transfer. Once registered, the domain has to &quot;sit-out&quot; at the same registrar for at least 60 days before it can be transferred out to another registrar . This is not something we&#039;ve made up, it is an ICANN regulation, you can read all about it in here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.icann.org/en/transfers/policy-12jul04.htm\r\n\r\nYou can have it transferred to any registrar of your choice but after the first 60 days period of registration.

We also offer PayPal, Payoneer and Escrow. Please note that we are willing to set up Escrow.com transactions only for domains that cost more than $300 and pay half the fee for their services as a sign of good will.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will my domain name be delivered to me?\r\n\r\nAs soon as you make the payment, our system will send you out Access Credentials. If you have ever purchased the domain from us before, you can just use your current Access Credentials. In case you&#039;re our new customer, we will send you an Email with your access credentials to the email you&#039;ve used to fill-in the order at our Payment Processor (2checkout.com,PayPal or Esscrow). \r\n\r\nWithin our Control Panel you will be able to do all the standard operations, like setting DNS, Whois Info, renewal, redirecting your new domain to your existing website and transfer. \r\n\r\nSince our Control Panel is just a &quot;Front-End&quot; for all of the Registrars we use, if you insist, we can push the domain to your account at the given Registrar (in 99% of the cases it&#039;s NameBright.com) \r\n\r\nBear in mind that for some domains the transfer is not possible in the first 60 days of the purchase period. This rule is not our policy (i.e. something we made up when we had nothing better to do), it&#039;s an ICANN regulation, and you can read all about it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.icann.org/resources/pages/name-holder-faqs-2012-02-25-en \r\n\r\nIn any case, the domain will be under your full control, and it will have your WHOIS info, in other words, it will be 100% yours, you just won&#039;t be able to transfer it to your hosting/registrar company during that initial 60-days-lock period. \r\nYou will still be able to use your current hosting company, set its DNS servers, or do with the domain whatever you want, you just won&#039;t be able to transfer it out during that period.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve entered wrong email when filling-in the order at your Payment Processor. What should I do?\r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake with your email when filling the order, please contact us at support@activedomainhosting.com and after we confirm it&#039;s really you (don&#039;t worry we don&#039;t ask for your dental record and blood samples like many of the companies do  ) we will resend you your Access Credentials to the proper email. \r\nWe are a small company with 15 employees only, and we generally already had some communication with our new clients before they purchased the domain, so don&#039;t worry you won&#039;t lose your domain just because any of our guys behaved like a bunch of support-bots  . \r\n\r\nDo you handle payments yourself?\r\n\r\nWe use 2CO.com a leading payment processor that is certified with the Better Business Bureau, European and US Safe Harbor laws. All transactions are encrypted with 128-bit SSL encryption and leverage McAfee and Thawte for security.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this a one time payment and are there any additional fees?\r\n\r\nThis is a one time payment and we will never bill you again for the same domain. Please note that we also give you one year of free registration ( unless stated otherwise in our emails) alongside with the domain. However, We do need to inform you that you will have to renew your domain after one year of registration expires. Should you decide to keep the domain with us, the renewal will cost $15/per year.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo I get a free full 1 year registration?\r\n\r\nAll domains we sell come with a free 1 year registration + 1 year free hosting package or WebSite Builder hosted on our platform.','','',0),(421,692,2393,0,'','','2016-12-03 01:38:09',' Please push my domain katesdate.com to namebright.com (account there is: miskandar) as soon as you can please.

You can also ask your domain provider about this, they can not accept the domain in before this period expires. ICANN is the governing body for domain names, it was introduced as a protection mechanism for buyers and sellers in case of any dispute. \r\n\r\nYou can use your hosting provider even when the domain is at the current registrar (NameBright.com) . We can redirect the domain in question to any website you wish until it&#039;s ready to be transferred out .\r\nAlternatively, if you feel more comfortable that way, you can open up an account with our registrar (NameBright.com) directly, and we can &quot;push&quot; your domain there. That way you won&#039;t be managing the domain through us, but directly at our registrar.  Some folks prefer that way, others prefer managing it through our interface. If you prefer managing the domain at registrar directly, you can open up your account at https://www.namebright.com/NewAccount  and give us:\r\n\r\n1) your account username and\r\n2) email address you&#039;ve used to open up that account (please don&#039;t send us your NameBright password :-)  )\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any case, after the stipulated time, we will be most willing to help you transfer it to your registrar if you would like ​us to. \r\n\r\nIf there&#039;s anything else you would like help with or need to know, please don&#039;t hesitate to contact us at any time.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nLarry Stevens\r\nTech Support\r\nADH','Larry Stevens','',0),(748,893,0,0,'','','2018-08-31 14:08:18','Hey teege.me!\r\n\r\nSorry for the problems you&#039;re having with unlocking the domain!

Our system has problems with &quot;talking&quot; to the underlying registrar (NameBright.com) and several other users have reported the same problem in the last few days.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I&#039;ve unlocked your domain, and retrieved your transfer authorization code.\r\n\r\nYour Authorization Code is: \r\n\r\nF2E?DG3XZPTT\r\n\r\nRegarding the WHOIS info, if you just plan to transfer it away, you don&#039;t really need to change it, since the WHOIS info won&#039;t be visible to anyone, including your &quot;destination&quot; registrar you&#039;re transferring the domain to. \r\n\r\nSince May 25th, 2018, all WHOIS info is basically hidden from the public, due to a change in ICANN&#039;s policy  (ICANN are, to put it simply, the governing body for all the domain names) . They have done so in order to align with the EU&#039;s latest Privacy Protection Law (also known as GDPR). Basically only a very few selected institutions, such as law enforcement agencies, courts etc. are able to see your WHOIS info, and domain name registrars and hosting companies are not one of them.\r\n\r\nThe reason you wanted to update WHOIS in the first place was likely because your registrar/hosting company haven&#039;t updated their instructions on how to transfer a domain name to them, and probably in one point they&#039;ve instructed you to update WHOIS, and that they will send the transfer confirmation email to the email address listed in whois info. \r\n\r\nThe thing is, there is no mechanism for them to send you that email anymore, due to aforementioned changes in ICANN&#039;s policies, and what will happen most likely is that the transfer will go through without their confirmation email ever being sent. i.e. they just won&#039;t going to send the transfer confirmation email, and that you will just need to have the domain unlocked and the transfer authorization code (I&#039;ve unlocked the domain, and I&#039;ve pasted you the code above).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I haven&#039;t explained this properly, and if I need to clarify any details bit better.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need any further help with transferring the domain (at least the part we can do on &quot;our&quot; side of things, please let us know.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nLarry Stevens\r\n','Larry Stevens','',0),(879,966,0,0,'','','2019-05-24 14:25:18','Hey Alan!\r\n\r\nYour account is registered under your other email, info@flagghillmarketing.com.
